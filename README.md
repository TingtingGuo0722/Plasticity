# Plasticity
Rice flowering time plasticity
We conducted four experiments in this research:
1) Envirionment Index Search. The sub functions and input files are uploaded. The major contributitons are from temperature and daylength.
The combinations of temperature and daylength are the major factor for flowering time on the population level. Also, plants sense environmental
index strongly during a critical developmental stage. Finding the critical stage for each population is the key step to understanding 
genotype-by-environment interaction and phenotypic plasticity.

2) Prediction. We had an explicit explanation on the genomic-prediction-based-on-reaction-norm-parameters and 
genomic-prediction-on-marker-effect-continuum. We also had an explicit descriptions on the prediction-of-tested-genotypes-on-untested-environments(1-2), prediction-of-untested-genotypes-on-tested-environments(1-3), and prediction-of-untested-genotypes-on-untested-environments(1-4).

3) QTL Mapping. We conducted QTL mapping by using software ICIM (www.isbreeding.net), by which QTLs were detected on additive effect, additive-by-additive-interaction effect, and additive-by-environment-interaction effect. Besides those, permutation test for defining QTL threshold were carried out.

4) Four Genes Haplotypes (from three-thousand-genome). We provided the snps with gene regions for Hd1, Hd2, Hd5 and Hd6. In ordor to know the geographic distributions of four-gene-combination, we also provided the origion of three thousand accessions.
