# Plasticity
Rice flowering time plasticity
We conducted four experiments in this research:
1) Envirionment Index Search. The sub functions and input files are uploaded. The major contributitons are from temperature and daylength.
The combinations of temperature and daylength are the major factor for flowering time on the population level. Also, plants sense environmental
index strongly during a critical developmental stage. Finding the critical stage for each population is the key step to understanding 
genotype-by-environment interaction and phenotypic plasticity.
